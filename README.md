I'm a software (Flutter) developer, who is passionate about using open-source technologies to build beautiful applications, creating technology to elevate people, 
and building community.  In 2018, I was nominated as an ambassador to WTM BONNY ISLAND, which I current am a lead, also I am a co-organiser of GDG BONNY ISLAND.
My interests are Cooking lovely dishes, Readding a book when not writing scripts. Building community is one of my strong suits, also very family-orirnted.

Building a strong women community in tech is what I keep looking up to in my local community - Bonny Island.
